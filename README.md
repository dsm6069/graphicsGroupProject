CPSC 3710 Group Project

This Project was made for my Graphics class Group Project and was made with two other students.
I was responsible for implementing the world and building generation, which I did using the pseudo
random number generation c-function rand() (which I understand is not the most elegant or effective
solution, but that was not the focus of the Project). I aimed to make the generation of the buildings
different every time the application was launched.

The Camera controls are:
W: Forward
A: Left
S: Backward
D: Right
Q: Rotate CounterClockwise 90 degrees
E: Rotate Clockwise 90degrees
